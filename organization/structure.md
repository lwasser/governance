# Structure and leadership

This page describes the organizational structure of pyOpenSci as they 
related to governance and operations. 

## Advisory Committee 

The advisory committee defines and steers the mission, vision and values of 
pyOpenSci. It also sets the strategic direction and vision for the organization.

<Should we create an email for this group?>
??The Advisory Committee group email (advisory@pyopensci.org) is the only “official” way
 to communicate with others on the advisory committee. ??

<TODO: right now the leadership of peer review is kind of clear in my head
but not clear in the documentation for peer review. Fix this. Add a 
Peer review structure document or section somewhere... >

1. Software review lead
2. [Editor in Chief](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/open-source-software-submissions/editor-in-chief-guide.html)
3. [Editorial board](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/open-source-software-submissions/editors-guide.html)
4. Volunteer reviewers ...

The review process is further supported by volunteer reviewers.
These roles are defined more clearly in our peer review guide.

## Fiscal sponsorship

pyOpenSci is a fiscally sponsored project of [Community
Initiatives](https://www.communityin.org).

pyOpenSci does not have its own standalone non-profit status. Instead, 
it inherits this status by being a fiscally sponsored project. This 
means that it relies on its fiscal sponsor for major administrative and 
legal services, including 501(c)(3) status and financial management.
